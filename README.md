<b>Abstract:</b>

One of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the global population is heart disease. One of the most crucial topics in the clinical data analysis subsection is the prediction of cardiovascular disease. The volume of information in the healthcare sector is enormous. The vast amount of unprocessed healthcare data is transformed via data mining into knowledge that may be used to make forecasts and educated judgments. The main cause of death for both men and women is heart disease. This makes heart disease a serious issue that has to be addressed. However, because of numerous contributing risk factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, an irregular pulse rate, and many other factors, it can be challenging to diagnose heart disease.Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.

<b>Project overview:</b>

Here in this project, we're going to predict the heart disease and create visualization from the dataset using Machine learning and Data analytics
